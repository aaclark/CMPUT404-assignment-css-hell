<span class="i0">This Rome, that was the toil of many men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The consummation of laborious years&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fulfilment's crown to visions of the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And image of the wide desire of kings&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is made my darkling dream's effulgency,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fuel of vision, brief embodiment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wandering will, and wastage of the strong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce ecstacy of one tremendous hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When ages piled on ages were a flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To all the years behind, and years to be.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet any sunset were as much as this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save for the music forced by hands of fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From out the hard strait silences which bind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dull Matter's tongueless mouth&mdash;a music pierced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the tense voice of Life, more quick to cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its agony&mdash;and save that I believed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The radiance redder for the blood of men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Destruction hastens and intensifies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The process that is Beauty, manifests<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ranges of form unknown before, and gives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Motion and voice and hue where otherwise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bleak inexpressiveness had leveled all.<span class="pagenum">[2]</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The laboured years and days league tow'rd an end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Less than the measure of desire, mayhap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After the sure consuming of all strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strain of faculties that otherwhere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were loosed upon enjoyment; and at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remains to one capacity nor power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For pleasure in the thing that he hath made.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But on destruction hangs but little use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of time or faculty, but all is turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the one purpose, unobstructed, pure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sensuous rapture and observant joy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the intensities of death and ruin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One draws a heightened and completer life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And both extends and vindicates himself.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I would I were a god, with all the scope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of attributes that are the essential core<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of godhead, and its visibility.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am but emperor, and hold awhile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The power to hasten Death upon his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cry a halt to worn and lagging Life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For others, but for mine own self may not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delay the one, nor bid the other speed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There have been many kings, and they are dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have no power in death save what the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confers upon their blown and brainless dust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To vex the eyeballs of posterity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But were I god, I would be overlord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of many kings, and were as breath to guide<span class="pagenum">[3]</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their dust of destiny. And were I god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exempt from this mortality which clogs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perception, and clear exercise of will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What rapture it would be, if but to watch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Destruction crouching at the back of Time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tongueless dooms which dog the travelling suns;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vampire Silence at the breast of worlds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fire without light that gnaws the base of things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Lethe's mounting tide, that rots the stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fundamental spheres. This were enough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till such time as the dazzled wings of will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came up with power's accession, scarcely felt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For very suddenness. Then would I urge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strong contention and conflicting might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of chaos and creation, matching them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those immemorial powers inimical,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all their stars and gulfs subservient&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dynasts of Time, and anarchs of the dark&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In closer war reverseless; and would set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New discord at the universal core,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Samson-principle to bring it down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one magnificence of ruin. Yea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monster Chaos were mine unleashed hound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all my power Destruction's own right arm!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I would exult to mark the smouldering stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Renew beneath my breath their elder fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feed upon themselves to nothingness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The might of suns, slow-paced with swinging weight<span class="pagenum">[4]</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of myriad worlds, were made at my desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One long rapidity of roaring light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through which the voice of Life were audible,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And singing of the immemorial dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose dust is loosened into vaporous wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With soaring wrack of systems ruinous.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And were I weary of the glare of these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would tear out the eyes of light, and stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above a chaos of extinguished suns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That crowd, and grind, and shiver thunderously,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lending vast voice and motion, but no ray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the stretched silence of the blinded gulfs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus would I give my godhead space and speech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For its assertion, and thus pleasure it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hastening the feet of Time with casts of worlds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like careless pebbles, or with shattered suns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brightening the aspect of Eternity.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Self-thwarting and confounded, of that strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was flung in centered impact terrible,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rush of all that fire, tempestuous-blown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if before some wind of further space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Striking the earth. Lo, all the Titans' flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bent back upon themselves, and they were hurled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vaster disarray, with vanguard piled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On rear and center. Saturn could not stem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The loosened torrents of long-pent defeat;<span class="pagenum">[97]</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, with his host, was but as drift thereon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Borne wildly down the whelmed and reeling world.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hurling like slanted rain, the lurid levin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell o'er that flight of Titans, and behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In striding menace, all-victorious Jove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loomed like some craggy cloud with thunders crowned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And footed with the winds. In that defeat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Jove's pursuit involved and manifold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Few found escape unscathed, and some went down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like senile suns that grapple with the dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reel in flame tremendous, and are still.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ebbing, the battle left those elder gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upcast once more on coasts of black defeat&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gripped in despair, a vaster Tartarus.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victor gods, their storms and thunders spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went dwindling northward like embattled clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where the lingering haze of fight dissolved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pallor of the dawn began to spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On darkness purple like the pain of Death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ringed with that desolation, Saturn stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mute, and the Titans answered unto him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With brother silence. Motionless, they seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some peristyle or range of columns great,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone enduring of a fallen fane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In deserts of some vaster world whence Life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Faith have vanished long, that vaguely slips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To an immemoried end. And twilight slow<span class="pagenum">[98]</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crept round those lofty shapes august, and seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as might be the faltering ghostly noon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mightier suns that totter down to death.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then turned they, passing from that dismal place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blasted anew with battle, ere the swift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Striding of light athwart stupendous chasms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wasteful plains, should overtake them there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bowed with too heavy a burden of defeat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly they turned, and passed upon the west<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, like a weariness immovable<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In menace huge, the plain its monstrous bulk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The peaks its hydra heads, the whole world crouched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against their march with the diminished stars.<br /></span>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
